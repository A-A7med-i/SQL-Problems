# Triangle Judgement
This program determines whether three given line segment lengths can form a valid triangle.

## Problem Description
The program takes an existing table named Triangle with three columns: x, y, and z. These columns represent the lengths of three line segments. The table's primary key is the combination of these three columns (x, y, z).

The program's goal is to analyze each row in the Triangle table and determine if the three side lengths satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. This theorem states that for any valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.
