# Customers Who Never Order (SQL Solution)
This heading indicates a problem statement related to a database scenario. It aims to identify customers who haven't placed any orders.

## Problem Description
We have two tables:

Customers: This table stores information about customers, likely including columns like id (unique identifier) and name.
Orders: This table stores information about orders, likely including columns like id (unique identifier) and customerId (foreign key referencing the id in the Customers table).
The goal is to find all customers who never placed any orders. In other words, we want to identify customers who are not associated with any entries in the Orders table.
