# Find Followers Count (SQL Solution)
Write a solution to find the number of followers for each user in the table. The result should be a new table with two columns:

user_id: The unique identifier of the user (same as the original table).
followers_count: The total number of followers for the user.

## Problem Description

You are given a social media followers table with two columns:

user_id: The unique identifier of a user.
follower_id: The unique identifier of a user who follows the user in the user_id column.
The table has a primary key that combines user_id and follower_id, ensuring no user follows another user more than once.
