# Top Travellers (SQL Solution)

Calculates the total distance traveled by each user in the Users and Rides tables and returns a sorted result.


## Problem Description

We have two tables:

Users: Contains user IDs and names.
Rides: Records user IDs and the distances they traveled in each ride.
The goal is to find the total distance traveled by each user and present the results in a table. The results should be ordered by:

travelled_distance (descending): Users who traveled the most distance come first.
name (ascending): If two users traveled the same distance, the user with the alphabetically lower name appears first.
