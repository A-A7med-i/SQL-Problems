# Classes More Than 5 Students (SQL Solution)

This script calculates the number of students enrolled in each class and identifies classes with at least five students.


## Problem Description
We have a table named Courses containing two columns:

student: Stores the name of a student (varchar data type).
class: Represents the class name the student is enrolled in (varchar data type).
The primary key for this table is a combination of student and class, ensuring unique enrollments.

The goal is to find all classes with five or more students enrolled and display them in a separate table. The order of the results doesn't matter.
